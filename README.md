# Assignment Dashboard

A web app that displays the forks of files in a GitHub repository (currently hardwired to `sd17spring/ReadingJournal`),
in tabular format.

## Status

Possible enhancements are listed [here](https://github.com/osteele/assignment-dashboard/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).


## Setup (using Docker)

Do these once:

### 1. Install docker-compose

For example: `pip install docker-compose`; or one of the installers [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 2. Retrieve a GitHub personal API token

[Create a personal GitHub API token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens).
Set the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable to this value.

### 3. Initialize the database

    docker-compose run flask initdb


## Usage (using Docker)

The admin tasks update the project database from GitHub.
The web application browses the data in this database.

### Admin Tasks

#### Update the database

    $ docker-compose run flask updatedb

This picks up new commits.

This will take a while to run the first time.
The next time it will skip commits that have already been ingested*, and will run faster.
It also saves its work one repository at a time (and after each downloaded file),
so if it is interrupted in the middle, it will pick up close to where it left off.


#### Set User Names

    $ docker-compose run flask set_usernames usernames.csv

Update user names in the database from the rows in `usernames.csv`.

`usernames.csv` should be a CSV file with a column named "name" or "username",
and a column that contains the string "git" (or mixed-case versions of these
strings).

Subsequent execution of `updatedb` will replace usernames in the database
by the user's GitHub name if the GitHub name is not empty.


### Run the Web Application

    $ docker-compose up

Then browse to <http://localhost:5000>.


## Setup (w/out Docker)

### 1. Install Python

Install Python 3.5 or greater. (Lesser versions of Python 3 will likely work but are untested. Python 2 is right out.)

### 2. Install required packages

Install [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org).

Then:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip3 install --process-dependency-links -e .

Depending on how Python is installed, you may need to prefix `pip3 install â€¦` by `sudo`.


### 3. Retrieve a GitHub personal API token

[Create a personal GitHub API token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens)
and set the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable to this value.


### 4. Initialize the database

    $ env FLASK_APP=assignment_dashboard flask initdb


## Usage (w/out Docker)

The admin tasks update the project database from GitHub.
The web application browses the data in this database.

### Admin Tasks

#### Update the database

    $ env FLASK_APP=assignment_dashboard flask updatedb

This picks up new commits.

This will take a while to run the first time.
The next time it will skip commits that have already been ingested*, and will run faster.
It also saves its work one repository at a time (and after each downloaded file),
so if it is interrupted in the middle, it will pick up close to where it left off.


#### Set User Names

      $ env FLASK_APP=assignment_dashboard flask set_usernames usernames.csv

Update user names in the database from the rows in `usernames.csv`.

`usernames.csv` should be a CSV file with a column named "name" or "username",
and a column that contains the string "git" (or mixed-case versions of these
strings).

A subsequent call to `flask updatedb` will replace usernames in the database
by the user's GitHub name if the GitHub name is not empty.


### Run the Web Application

    $ env FLASK_APP=assignment_dashboard flask run

Then browse to <http://localhost:5000>.

### What to Work On

The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/osteele/assignment-dashboard/issues) lists bugs and enhancement requests.

### How to Work

`scripts/shell` starts a Python REPL with the globals in the `database` and
`models` imported at top-level. This script uses the techniques from
[preconfigured interactive shell](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/23/)
and [further improving the shell experience](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/shell/#further-improving-the-shell-experience).

Both the Docker and non-Docker strategies for running the application are set
to reload the application when files are changed. (`FLASK_DEBUG` is set to `1`
to set this for Flask. And, in Docker, the host directory is mounted to `/app`
inside the image.)

### Style

With exceptions listed in `setup.cfg`, code should conform to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), and the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

You can verify code against these style guides via:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt  # once
    $ flake8 scripts                        # before each commit

or by setting up a [git pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to run the latter command.
